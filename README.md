# VoxelWorldGame
Game I made in unity focused on generating large amounts of voxels by carefully managing vertices.

Used perlin noise to create terrain similar to Minecraft. Managed merging meshes and avoided drawing faces that were not visible. Used coroutines to build out large sections of voxels and merged them together to create world chunks containing many voxels
